# playlist-manager
The Playlist Manager application scans a directory of audio files and provides the ability to create playlist files in the "*.m3u" format.

Various devices, such as portable MP3 players and auto entertainment systems, support the M3U format for playlist files.   Creating a playlist file on a computer can be challenging because it needs to reference the media's location on the music device.

This applcation will scan the tree of audio files and allow to user to add to a playlist file based on the artist name, the genre property or the source folder (usually an artist name, but not necessarily).  Note: the various media properties must be populated for a file to be categorized by artist or genre.
